# Comparison_FIle_Program
This program takes files from two different pipelines that analyze NGS molecular cancer data from patients and compares results for consistency and accuracy. The user using this program must provide the files from two different workflow for comparison. So the file types are: trimmed fastq files, BAM files, gene.counts files, isoform.results files, star-fusion.tsv files, arriba.tsv files and a metrics.tsv file. Make sure the correct format is being used and the correct data is inside each of the files, otherwise it will not work!  For example: the trim and BAM comparison is set up to provide feedback from numbers of reads not string values. So make sure the files you provide coinsides with how the program runs! See the diagram below...
